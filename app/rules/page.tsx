        <p>ImmerseGT promotes a safe and inclusive environment for all participants. Harassment and abuse are not tolerated, and anyone who experiences or witnesses such behavior should report it using the procedures outlined in this policy.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class, economic status, veteran status, sharing sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, brigading, doxxing, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. If someone is making another person feel uncomfortable, it is considered harassment and must stop immediately.</li>
            <li>All participants, including sponsors, judges, mentors, volunteers, organizers, and ImmerseGT staff, are subject to this anti-harassment policy. Attendees should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material in their projects or during the event. Booth staff, including volunteers, should not use sexualized clothing, uniforms, costumes, or create a sexualized environment.</li>
            <li>ImmerseGT may take any action it deems appropriate, including warning or expelling participants who engage in harassing behavior with no eligibility for reimbursement or refund of any kind.</li>
            <li>If you experience or witness harassment, or have any other concerns, please report it using the procedures outlined in this policy.

All participants are expected to follow these rules at all event venues, online interactions, and hackathon-related social events.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Grand Judging Expo is the culminating event of the hackathon where various judges will go around and evaluate teams throughout the two hours. This is an opportunity for teams to showcase their projects, explain their vision, and demonstrate the features of their solutions. Be prepared to answer questions and provide a demo to the judges. Remember, the more prepared and organized your presentation is, the better your chances of winning. Good luck!</p>
